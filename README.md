# Interactive Zine Maker

I used Base44 to create this app.
It's a Vite+React app that communicates with the Base44 API.
It's MIT licensed. Share, remix, create your own zines :heart:

## Running the app

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building the app

```bash
npm run build
```

## Try it in action
My first prototype - [shattered self](https://shatteredself.base44.app/)

## On the roadmap
- Pull out the Base44 integrations. Yes, all of them.
- Change integrations for the text-to-image LLM so it can make more stuff.
- Work on performance. This app is *slow*.
